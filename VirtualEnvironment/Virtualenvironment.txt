To create a virtual environment you need to run: python -m venv myenv
This will create a myenv folder on the location where you are present at this moment.
Now to access that virtual environment you need to run: 
source myenv/bin/activate --> On Bash
cd myenv/Scripts/
.\Activate.ps1 --> Run it
To get out of the virtual environment you can run: deactivate.
To check all the modules that you have installed on the virtual environment run: pip freeze
